              DALL·E is an AI system developed by OpenAI that can create
              original, realistic images and art from a short text description.
              It can make realistic and context-aware edits, including
              inserting, removing, or retouching specific sections of an image
              from a natural language description. It can also take an image and
              make novel and creative variations of it inspired by the original.{" "}

              How DALL·E Works
              <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                <li>
                  DALL·E was trained by learning the relationship between images
                  and the text used to describe them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It uses a process called diffusion, which starts with a
                  pattern of random dots and gradually alters that pattern
                  towards a final output.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br /> DALL·E Credits
              <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                <li>
                  A credit can be used for one DALL·E request: generating images
                  through a text prompt, an edit request, or a variation
                  request.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You get 50 free credits your first month, and 15 free credits
                  will refill every month after that. Free credits don’t roll
                  over, so they’ll expire a month after they were granted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can purchase additional credits through your account page.
